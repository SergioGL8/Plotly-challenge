In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1: Plotly

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard


## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Deployment

* Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

## Hints

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
